# Zeebe Go Client

> [!WARNING]
> The Zeebe Go Client was officially deprecated with 8.6 release as part of our efforts to streamline the Camunda 8 API experience. This client will not get released with Camunda 8.6, thus no longer receive new features and will be transitioned to a community-maintained status.

### What Does This Mean for Users?

* No New Features or Updates: Starting with Camunda 8.6, the Go Client will no longer receive new features, updates, or official support from Camunda.
* The official Go client and zbctl will only remain available and maintained for supported minor versions up to Camunda 8.5.
* Community Maintenance: The Go Client was moved to [camunda-community-hub/zeebe-client-go](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/zeebe-client-go) and can be maintained by the community. We encourage contributions from users who wish to continue using and improving this client.
* Transition to REST API: We recommend users transition to the Camunda 8 REST API for all future development. The REST API provides comprehensive functionality and is supported by tools such as cURL, Postman, and OpenAPI.

### Future Considerations

We value feedback from our community. Based on user input, we may explore developing a new client for the Camunda 8 REST API, based on a different technology that aligns with our strategic goals and internal expertise.
