/**
 * An implementation of {@link RaftLogFlusher} which treats calls to {@link #flush(Journal)} as
 * signals that there is data to be flushed. When that happens, an asynchronous operation is
 * scheduled with a predefined delay. If a flush was already scheduled, then the signal is ignored.
 *
 * <p>In other words, this implementation flushes at least every given period, if there is anything
 * to flush.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: this class is not thread safe, and is expected to run from the same thread as the
 * journal write path, e.g. the Raft thread.
