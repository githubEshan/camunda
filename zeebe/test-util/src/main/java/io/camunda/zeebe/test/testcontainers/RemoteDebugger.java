/**
 * To use, create a new instance with the desired port (or, by default, 5005), and pass the
 * container you wish to configure to it.
 *
 * <p>This will start the container and wait for the debugger to attach. To use with Intellij,
 * create a new debug configuration template and pick "Remote JVM Debug". By default, it will be
 * setup for port 5005, which is the default port here as well. You can find out more about this
 * from <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/tutorial-remote-debug.html">this IntelliJ
 * tutorial</a>.
 *
 * <p>This idea came from bsideup's blog, and you can read more about it <a

 *
 * <p>TODO(npepinpe): document, and add to zeebe-test-container as base capability
